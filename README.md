# Co-Pilot Test

Using the prompt in co-pilot the following code was outputed to phoneParser.js and index.html

This is a test of how well code generation works.

Overall ok, it took a few iterations to get to working as I wanted it code.  Could have possibly used another library or self coded in about the same ammount of time and required knowing what I wanted and how to get it for the prompt to ultimately work.
